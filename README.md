# PfDA Project 2: An Analysis of Paleo-Present Climate Data

## CONTENT

<div align="justify">

Welcome to the **Paleo-Present Climate Data Analysis** project! This analysis is organized into five key sections, each contributing to our understanding of climate change:

1. **CO2 vs. Temperature Anomaly (800kyrs – Present)**: Explore the historical relationship between CO2 levels and temperature anomalies over an extensive timeframe.

2. **Examination of Additional Climate Features**: Investigate the impact of global warming on polar ice coverage, with insights from paleoclimate data and modern observations.

3. **Irish Context**: Analyze climate trends specific to Ireland, offering localized perspectives on global climate change.

4. **Predictions for Global Temperature**: Utilize data synthesis and climate modeling to project future temperature trends under different emissions scenarios.

5. **Conclusion – Accelerated Warming**: Summarize findings and emphasize the urgency of addressing accelerated warming's implications for our planet.</div>
